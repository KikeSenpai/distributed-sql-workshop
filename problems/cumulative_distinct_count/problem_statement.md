# Problem Statement

Julia conducted a  days of learning SQL contest. 
The start date of the contest was `2016-03-01`, and the end date was `2016-03-15`.
Write a query to output the date, the number of unique hackers who made at least one submission each date until that date, the `hacker_id` and `hacker_name` of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each date, all sorted by date in ascending order.
If more than one hacker has the maximum number of submissions, output the lowest `hacker_id`.
